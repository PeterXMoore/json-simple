    The json-simple library is meant to be a lightweight utility for deserializing and serializing things in Javascript Object Notation (JSON). It aims to be easy to learn and use.

    Define how your objects are serialized as JSON by implementing the Jsonable interface.<br />
    <br />
    JsonArray and JsonObject extend ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; and HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; respectively and have typed getters for each kind of JSON value.<br />

    I hope you like where the project is headed and would love to have your support. I've included the project history below for those <a href="https://github.com/cliftonlabs/json-simple/issues/6">confused or interested</a> in the origins of the project.
    <p>
      This project was formerly <a href="https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple">JSON.simple</a> from a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/">Google code project</a> by <a href="https://github.com/fangyidong">Yidong</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1.* versions of the library had the potential to produce bad JSON, its documentation was uncentralized privately hosted in various locations around the Internet, and with many issues open on the project it seemed the upstream was dead and fairly important to many projects since it had a unique architecture. A few of those projects were internal for Clifton Labs, so it was decided there was value in updating the library and attempt to merge upstream to share our work with anyone else that could benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      After redesigning the library to be backwards compatible it was decided that support for java 2 to 6 would be dropped in favor of generics (thus a 2.* version) as it was the most avidly requested feature. The library was also written in the package org.json.simple so a maven artifact under the org.json.simple groupId made sense. Once all that work was done it was up to the merge with upstream to take over the rest. However, after many emails and external issues only the first part went according to plan. So, the project is now maintained by Clifton Labs and the maven artifacts are now published under com.github.cliftonlabs.
